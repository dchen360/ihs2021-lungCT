# IHS 2021 Code Repository: COVID-19 Severity Prediction from Lung Radiography Images Using Deep Learning

The official code repository corresponding to the results obtained in [COVID-19 Severity Prediction from Lung Radiography Images Using Deep Learning](./IHS_2021_Submission.pdf).

Even though the results listed are subpar, we believe our work holds value in suggesting possible avenues by which researchers may avoid the challenges we faced.

## Background
- CT scans are more rapid, sensitive than RT-PCR testing for COVID-19.
- High case volumes lead to medical errors as doctors examine CT scans with limited time.
- Need for automated algorithm to accurately triage COVID-19 patients based on CT scans.
